# nuber

Inspired by [epy](https://github.com/wustho/epy), *nuber* is an Epub terminal reader with inline images written with Rust and Python using [Ãœberzug](https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug). Currently in its early stages, *nuber* has simple `hjkl` navigation and is very limited in its features.
